## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Research]: Upgrade to Next.js 15+ recommended over specified 14 (low migration risk, React 19, Turbopack)
- [Research]: Tailwind v4 requires CSS-based `@theme` config — must be correct in Phase 1 or everything breaks downstream
- [Research]: Use LazyMotion + domAnimation at root layout level to prevent Framer Motion bundle bloat
- [Research]: All page.tsx files must be Server Components — `'use client'` only at leaf interactive components

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Confirm Next.js 14 vs 15+ decision with owner before project init (research recommends 15+)
- [Pre-Phase 6]: Material Calculator coverage formula per material type needs values defined before Phase 6 planning
- [Pre-launch]: Real project photos from owner needed to replace placeholders before site goes live
